# mDDE - mini-Dynamic Data Economy

## Intro
Dynamic Data Economy (DDE) is a roadmap towards fair, decentralized and authentic data economy. Many times people are referring to blockchain technology as a revolution within digital space. But often they actually mean something more profound: the promise of Decentralisation brought by blockchain. A Dynamic Data Economy brings decentralization outside the technology realm into digital solution for any economic actors. It does so by decentralizing all layers of the ecosystem:

- Decentralized Governance - no administrative entity fully controls and sets the rules, Individuals, organization and government are sovereign on their data Governance.
- Decentralized Architecture - physically decentralization of resources running that network. Economic actors keep control of their data storage solution according to the level of security required.
- Decentralized Logic (Data) - if you cut the system in half it can continue working and data is not damaged in any way, e.g. no need for total ordering.

No blockchain fulfills all those requirements and some none at all. And this is a problem for sensitive areas (e.g. identity or data portability) Then the agreements on sets of principles, protocols and rules to fulfill those requirements are “add-ons”.They are not in the system by design and thus weakens the overall solution Thus the Human Colossus Foundation (HCF) is seeking for opening up discussion and lead towards standardization efforts to ensure that the decentralized technologies already existing brings to life a Dynamic Data Economy for all with and without blockchain.
